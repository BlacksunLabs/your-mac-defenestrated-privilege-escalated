PoC's provided are generally not the same as those shown in live demos during the presentation. The plists are fairly neutered and provide a working example intended to be weaponized by the end-user.


If you would like to have weaponized versions of these techniques or are interested in having a custom solution developed for your team, please email  noncetonic å† blacksunhackers.club for project consideration, pricing, and availability of our Offensive Security Engineering team. Corporate Redteams encouraged to contact to address any workflow automation, offensive TTP research and development, and custom tooling needs. Serious enquiries only.
